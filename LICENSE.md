  intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or
  its utilization under this License), USER must include a text file
  with the source code provided to Robert Cowart titled "LEGAL" which
  describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient
  detail that Robert Cowart will know whom to contact. If USER obtains
  such knowledge after USER makes the Modification available to
  Robert Cowart, USER shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
  USER makes available thereafter and shall notify Robert Cowart that
  new knowledge has been obtained.

  (b) Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application
  programming interface and USER owns or controls patents, which are
  reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include
  this information in the LEGAL file.

3.2. Required Notices. USER must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in
  each file or repository of the Source Code, and this License in any
  documentation for the Source Code, where USER describes recipients'
  rights relating to Covered Code. If USER created one or more
  Modification(s), USER may add name as a Contributor to the notice
  described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in
  a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then USER must
  include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory
  file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.

3.3. Distribution of Executable Versions. This license does not allow
  distribution of the Covered Code by USER or Contributor.

3.4. Larger Works. USER may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
  Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License. In
  such a case, USER must make sure the requirements of this License
  are fulfilled for the Covered Code including 2.1d and 2.1e.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

  If it is impossible for USER to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
  statute or regulation then USER must:

  (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
  possible; and

  (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
  description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section
  3.1 and must be included with all distributions of the Source
  Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
  description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
  ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

  This License applies to Covered Code attached to the notice in Exhibit A.

6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

  COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
  INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS
  FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
  NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
  THE COVERED CODE IS WITH USER. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE
  DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT ROBERT COWART OR ANY OTHER
  CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
  CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL
  PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
  HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

7. TERMINATION.

  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically if USER fails to comply with terms herein. All
  sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
  survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
  nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
  shall survive.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL ROBERT
  COWART, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
  CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO USER OR
  ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
  FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
  LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
  APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
  PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
  LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION
  AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO USER.


9. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS,

  The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
  48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995). consisting of "commercial computer
  software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
  terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
  C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June
  1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only
  those rights set forth herein.

10. MISCELLANEOUS.

  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
  matter hereof. Nothing in this AGREEMENT shall be construed as
  conferring by implication, estoppel or otherwise any license or
  rights other than those granted in this License. If any provision of
  this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
  reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This
  License shall be governed by German law provisions (except to the
  extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise). The application
  of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
  Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
  provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against
  the drafter shall not apply to this License.
